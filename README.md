# NLP-Sequence-Tagging
First Assignment in the 'NLP - Natural Languages Processing' course by Prof. Yoav Goldberg, Prof. Ido Dagan and Prof. Reut Tsarfaty at Bar-Ilan University.

The assignment involves implementing two sequence taggers: a greedy tagger based on local classification, and a tagger that uses global search by employing the Viterbi algorithm.
The global search tagger is based on the trigram hidden Markov models (HMM), and the local tagger is based on a logistic-regression classifier.

These taggers are applied to tackle both the Part-of-Speech (POS) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.
