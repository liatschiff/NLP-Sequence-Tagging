# NLP-Sequence-Tagging

First Assignment in 'NLP - Natural Languages Processing' course by Prof. Yoav Goldberg, Prof. Ido Dagan and Prof. Reut Tsarfaty at Bar-Ilan University.

Implementing two sequence taggers: a greedy tagger based on local classication, and a tagger that uses global search, using
the Viterbi algorithm.

The global search tagger is based on the trigram HMM model, and the local classier tagger is based on the logistic-regression classifier.
Both taggers are applied for addressing the Part-of-Speech (POS) and the Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.
